# Titanic Project

## Project Title
Predicting Titanic Survival based on Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create predictive machine learning models to predict whether or not a passenger survives the Titanic tragedy. Binary classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost were trained and evaluated on the training dataset. A champion model was then selected to predict on the test dataset if a passenger survives or not.
